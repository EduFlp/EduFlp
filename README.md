## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on basic frontend. I use knowledge of CSS, HTML and JavaScript to create some websites pages through challenges proposed by the Frontend Mentor.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning MySQL. I have track of courses to take about the world of programming.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on web development projects as I could improve my knowledge and get a job.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with people who are wiling to teach more about the full-stack world and who can contribute to my work.
- âš¡ Fun fact: It is my hobby!
